Clever Lily:



Lily is already N years old. She receives a gift for each of her birthdays.

 For odd birthdays (1, 3, 5 ... n) receives toys.

 For even birthdays (2, 4, 6 ... n) receives money.

For the second birthday he receives BGN 10.00, the amount being increased by BGN 10.00, for each subsequent even birthday (2 -> 10, 4 -> 20, 6 -> 30 ... etc.). Over the years, Lily has secretly saved money. Lily's brother, in the years she received money, took BGN 1.00 from them. Lily sold the toys received over the years, each for P BGN and added the amount to the money saved. With the money she wanted to buy a washing machine for X leva. Write a program to calculate how much money she has raised and whether she has enough to buy a washing machine

 Unit price of a toy - an integer in the range [0 ... 40]



Output:


Print one line on the console:

 If Lily's money is enough:

 If the money is not enough:

o "No! {M}" - where M is the amount that is not enough
