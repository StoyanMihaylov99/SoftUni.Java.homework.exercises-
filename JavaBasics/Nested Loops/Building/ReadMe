Building:



Write a program that displays the room numbers in a building (in descending order) on the console if the following conditions are met:

 There are only offices on each even-numbered floor

 There are only apartments on each odd-numbered floor

 Each apartment is designated as follows: A{floor number}{apartment number}, apartment numbers start from 0.

 Each office is designated as follows: O{floor number}{office number}, office numbers also start from 0.

 There are always apartments on the top floor and they are larger than the others, that's why they have an 'L' in front of the number instead of an 'A'. If there is only one floor, then there are only large apartments!

Two integers are read from the console - the number of floors and the number of rooms per floor.





Example:
 
Input:            Output:

  6             L60 L61 L62 L63 
  4             A50 A51 A52 A53 
                O40 O41 O42 O43
                A30 A31 A32 A33 
                O20 O21 O22 O23 
                A10 A11 A12 A13
