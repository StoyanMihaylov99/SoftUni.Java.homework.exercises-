Write a program that matches a date in the format "dd{separator}MMM{separator}yyyy". Use named capturing groups in your regular expression.

Compose the Regular Expression

Every valid date has the following characteristics:

 Always starts with two digits, followed by a separator.

 After that, it has one uppercase and two lowercase letters (e.g., Jan, Mar).

 After that, it has a separator and exactly 4 digits (for the year).

 The separator could be either of three things: a period ("."), a hyphen ("-") or a forward-slash ("/").

 The separator needs to be the same for the whole date (e.g., 13.03.2016 is valid, 13.03/2016 is NOT). Use a group back reference to check for this.



Example:



Input:


13/Jul/1928, 10-Nov-1934, , 01/Jan-1951,f 25.Dec.1937 23/09/1973, 1/Feb/2016



Output:


Day: 13, Month: Jul, Year: 1928

Day: 10, Month: Nov, Year: 1934

Day: 25, Month: Dec, Year: 1937
