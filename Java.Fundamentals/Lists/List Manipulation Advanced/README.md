List Manipulation Advanced:


Now we will implement more complicated list commands. Again, read a list, and until you receive "end" read commands:

Contains {number} – check if the list contains the number. If yes, print "Yes", otherwise, print "No such number"

Print even – print all the numbers that are even separated by a space

Print odd – print all the numbers that are oddly separated by a space

Get sum – print the sum of all the numbers

Filter {condition} {number} – print all the numbers that fulfill that condition. The condition will be either '<', '>', ">=", "<="




Example:




Input:

2 13 43 876 342 23 543

Contains 100

Contains 543

Print even

Print odd

Get sum

Filter >= 43

Filter < 100

end




Output:


No such number
Yes
2 876 342 
13 43 23 543 
1842
43 876 342 543 
2 13 43 23
