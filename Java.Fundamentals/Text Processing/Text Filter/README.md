Write a program that takes a text and a string of banned words. All words included in the ban list should be replaced with asterisks "*", equal to the word's length. The entries in the ban list will be separated by a comma and space ", ".

The ban list should be entered on the first input line and the text on the second input line.




Example:


Input:


Linux, Windows

It is not Linux, it is GNU/Linux. Linux is

merely the kernel, while GNU adds the

functionality. Therefore we owe it to them

by calling the OS GNU/Linux! Sincerely, a

Windows client



Output:


It is not *****, it is GNU/*****. ***** is merely the kernel, while GNU adds the functionality. Therefore we owe it to them by calling the OS GNU/*****! Sincerely, a ******* client
