On the first line, you are given the length of two sets, N and M. On the next N + M lines, there are N numbers that are in the first set and M numbers that are in the second one. Find all non-repeating element that appears in both of them, and print them in the same order at the console:

Set with length N = 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}

Set with length M = 3: {3, 4, 5}

Set that contains all repeating elements -> {3, 5}
