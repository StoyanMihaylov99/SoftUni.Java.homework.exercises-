Given a sequence consisting of parentheses, determine whether the expression is balanced. A sequence of parentheses is balanced if every open parenthesis can be paired uniquely with a closing parenthesis that occurs after the former. Also, the interval between them must be balanced.
You will be given three types of parentheses: (, {, and [.
{[()]} - This is a balanced parenthesis.
{[(])} - This is not a balanced parenthesis.


Input
·	Each input consists of a single line, the sequence of parentheses.
·	1 ? Length of sequence ? 1000.
·	Each character of the sequence will be one of the following: {, }, (, ), [, ].


Output
·	For each test case, print on a new line "YES" if the parentheses are balanced. Otherwise, print "NO".



Example:



Input:

{[()]}
--------------
{[(])}


Output:

YES
--------------
NO
