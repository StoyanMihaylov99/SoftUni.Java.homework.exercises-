Write a program that takes two types of browser instructions:

· Normal navigation: a URL is set, given by a string;

· The string "back" sets the current URL to the last set URL

After each instruction, the program should print the current URL. If the back instruction can't be executed, print "no previous URLs". The input ends with the "Home" command, and then you simply have to stop the program.





Example:



https//softuni.bg/

back

https//softuni.bg/trainings/courses

back

https//softuni.bg/trainings/2056

back

https//softuni.bg/trainings/live

https//softuni.bg/trainings/live/details

Home



Output:


https//softuni.bg/ no previous URLs https//softuni.bg/trainings/courses https//softuni.bg/ https//softuni.bg/trainings/2056 https//softuni.bg/ https//softuni.bg/trainings/live https//softuni.bg/trainings/live/details
