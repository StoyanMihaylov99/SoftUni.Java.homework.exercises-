Mathematical expressions are written in an infix notations, for example "5 / ( 3 + 2 )". However, this kind of notation is not efficient for computer processing, as you first need to evaluate the expression inside the brackets, so there is a lot of back and forth movement. A more suitable approach is to convert it into the so-called postfix notations (also called Reverse Polish Notation), in which the expression is evaluated from left to right, for example, "3 2 + 5 /".
Implement an algorithm that converts the mathematical expression from infix notation into a postfix notation. Use the famous Shunting-yard algorithm.

Input
·	You will receive an expression on a single line consisting of tokens.
·	Tokens could be numbers 0-9, variables a-z, operators +, -, *, / and brackets ( or ).
·	Each token is separated by exactly one space.

Output
·	The output should be on a single line, consisting of tokens separated by exactly one space.


Example:

Input:

7 + 13 / ( 12 - 4 )


Output:

7 13 12 4 - / +
