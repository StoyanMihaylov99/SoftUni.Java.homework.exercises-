Write a program that reads two char matrices (A[][] and B[][]) of the same order M * N and prints the third matrix C[][], which is filled with the intersecting elements of A and B, otherwise set the element to '*'. On the first two lines, you receive M and N, then on 2 * M lines N characters – the matrices elements.

The matrix elements may be any ASCII char except '*'.




Example:


Input:


3

4

a b c d

a b c d

a b c d

k b c k

a b g d

a k c d




Output:



* b c * 
a b * d 
a * c d
