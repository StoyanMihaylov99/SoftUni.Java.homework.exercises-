Write a program that reads a matrix of integers from the console, then a number, and prints all the positions at which that number appears in the matrix.

The matrix definition on the console will contain a line with two positive integer numbers R and C – the number of rows and columns in the matrix – followed by R lines, each containing C numbers (separated by spaces), representing each row of the matrix.

The number you will need to find the positions will be entered on a single line after the matrix.

You should print each position on a single line – first print the row, then the column at which the number appears.

If the number does not appear in the matrix, print "not found".




Example:



Input:



2 3

1 2 3

4 2 2

2




Output:



0 1
1 1 
1 2
