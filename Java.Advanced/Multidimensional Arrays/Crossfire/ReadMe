You will receive two integers, which represent the dimensions of a matrix. Then, you must fill the matrix with increasing integers starting from 1, and continuing on every row, like this: first row: 1, 2, 3, …, n second row: n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, …, n + n third row: 2 * n + 1, 2 * n + 2, …, 2 * n + n

You will also receive several commands in the form of 3 integers separated by a space. Those 3 integers will represent a row in the matrix, a column, and a radius. You must then destroy the cells, which correspond to those arguments cross-like.

Destroying a cell means that that cell becomes completely nonexistent in the matrix. Destroying cells cross-like means that you form a cross figure with a center point - equal to the cell with coordinates – the given row and column, and lines with length equal to the given radius. See the examples for more info.

The input ends when you receive the command "Nuke it from orbit". When that happens, you must print what has remained from the initial matrix.




Example:



Input:


5 5

3 3 2

4 3 2

Nuke it from orbit



Output:


1 2 3 4 5 
6 7 8 10 
11 12 13 
16 21
